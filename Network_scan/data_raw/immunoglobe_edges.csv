Unlike other CD28-family members, however, BTLA does not interact with B7 ligands but binds a member of the TNF receptor family; called the herpesvirus entry molecule (HVEM), this receptor is highly expressed on resting T cells and immature dendritic cells. When BTLA and HVEM are co-expressed on the same cell, BTLA utilizes a second mechanism that further inhibits lymphocyte activation. In this configuration, BLTA binds to HVEM and prevents HVEM from binding to alternative partners that would stimulate NF<U+03BA>B-dependent pro-survival signaling pathways downstream of HVEM. Alternatively, when BTLA and HVEM are expressed on different cells, the interaction of these two receptors functions to stimulate the positive pro-survival signal in the HVEM-expressing cell.","B (Survive) DC","false","Survive","B (Survive) DC","BTLA","HVEM"

The ratio of IgA1 to IgA2 varies markedly depending on the tissue, being about 10:1 in the blood and upper respiratory tract, about 3:2 in the small intestine, and 2:3 in the colon... In mice, only one IgA isotype is found, and it is most closely similar to IgA2 in humans.; 424: Monomeric IgA can be produced by plasma cells that differentiate from class-switched B cells in lymph nodes and spleen, and it acts as a neutralizing antibody in extracellular spaces and in the blood.; 524: Figure 12.23; 500: The lamina propria contains many types of immune cells, including IgA-producing plasma cells, conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells with effector and memory phenotypes, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells.; 522: Presentation of these antigens generates IgA-switched B cells that localize in the lamina propria as IgA-producing plasma cells (right panel). IgA then binds commensal bacteria, altering their gene expression, limiting their access to the epithelium, and blocking their binding to the surface.

Once in the lamina propria, the B cells undergo final differentiation into plasma cells, which synthesize IgA dimers and secrete them into the subepithelial space (Fig. 12.11).; 431: IgA antibodies are synthesized as monomers, which enter blood and extracellular fluids, or they are secreted as dimeric molecules by plasma cells in the lamina propria of various mucosal tissues.; 502: Antigen-specific naive B cells in the follicular areas of Peyer’s patches undergo isotype switching from IgM to IgA production there, but they only differentiate fully into IgA-producing plasma cells once they have returned to the lamina propria.; 544: Figure 13.5; 425: In the mucosal immune system, IgA-secreting plasma cells are found predominantly in the lamina propria, which lies immediately below the basement membrane of many surface epithelia.; 506: The dominant class of antibody in the mucosal immune system is IgA, which is produced locally by plasma cells in the mucosal wall.; 509: In mice, unlike humans, a significant proportion of intestinal IgA is derived from T-cell-independent B-cell activation and class switching. This depends on activation of the innate immune system by the products of commensal microbes and may result from the direct interaction of B cells with conventional dendritic cells and follicular dendritic cells in solitary lymphoid follicles. This antibody production seems to involve lymphocytes of the B-1 subset (see Section 8-9), which arise from precursor B cells in the peritoneal cavity and migrate to the intestinal wall in response to microbial constituents such as lipopolysaccharide.","B (Secrete) IgA","false","Secrete","B (Secrete) IgA","",""

"Antibody production","Activate","406: Activated B cells express ICOSL, a member of the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules and a ligand for ICOS (inducible co-stimulatory protein), which is expressed by T cells. This T- and B-cell interaction, provided by linked recognition, activates ICOS signaling in T cells and is important for the completion of TFH differentiation (see Section 7-21), leading to induction of the transcription factors Bcl-6 and c-Maf.; 30: CD4 T cells recognize antigen presented by MHC class II proteins, which are expressed by the predominant antigen-presenting cells of the immune system: dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells; 166: When previously activated CD4 T cells recognize peptides bound to MHC class II molecules on B cells, the T cells secrete cytokines that can influence the isotype of antibody that those B cells will choose to produce.; 216: In B cells, antigen presentation may serve to recruit help from CD4 T cells that recognize the same protein antigen as the B cell. By efficiently endocytosing a specific antigen via their surface immunoglobulin and presenting the antigen-derived peptides on MHC class II molecules, B cells can activate CD4 T cells that will in turn serve as helper T cells for the production of antibodies against that antigen.; 223: The immunological function of MHC class II molecules is to bind peptides generated in the intracellular vesicles of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and to present these peptides to CD4 T cells. The purpose for this pathway is different for each cell type. Dendritic cells primarily are concerned with activating CD4 T cells, while macrophages and B cells are concerned with receiving various forms of help from these CD4 T cells.; 401: This occurs when antigen bound by surface immunoglobulin on the B cell is internalized and degraded within the B cell and peptides derived from it are returned to the cell surface in a complex with MHC class II molecules (see Fig. 10.2, first panel). When the TFH cell recognizes these peptide:MHC complexes, it provides the B cell with signals that favor survival and induce proliferation. These signals include the activation of CD40 on B cells by TFH expression of its ligand, CD40L (CD154), and production of various cytokines by TFH cells, including IL-21 (Fig. 10.3).; 421: Helper T cells recognize peptide fragments derived from the antigen internalized by the B cells and displayed by the B cells as peptide:MHC class II complexes.; 421: Activated B cells also express molecules, such as ICOSL, that can stimulate T cells; 282: One key function of the immune synapse in B cells is to promote antigen uptake by the B cell, a prerequisite to presenting that antigen in the form of peptide:MHC complexes to CD4 T cells.; 402: When these TFH cells are activated by B cells presenting their peptide, they are stimulated to provide specific signals that help B cells to generate antibodies against the viral coat protein (Fig. 10.4).; 476: Memory B cells express somewhat higher levels of MHC class II molecules and the co-stimulatory ligand B7.1 than do naive B cells. This helps memory B cells acquire and present antigen more efficiently to TFH cells compared with naive B cells, and to TFH cells through the B7.1 receptor CD28, so that they can in turn help in antibody production so it begins earlier after antigen exposure compared with primary responses.; 476: As in primary responses, secondary B-cell responses begin at the interface between the T-cell and B-cell zones, where memory B cells that have acquired antigen can present peptide:MHC class II complexes to helper T cells.

This priming step can result from TLR signaling, which may help ensure that inflammasome activation proceeds primarily during infections...  Several other NLR family members form inflammasomes with ASC and caspase 1 that activate these pro-inflammatory cytokines. NLRP1 is highly expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells and is activated directly by MDP, similar to NOD2, but can also be activated by other factors. For example, Bacillus anthracis expresses an endopeptidase, called anthrax lethal factor, which allows the pathogen to evade the immune system by killing macrophages. Lethal factor does this by cleaving NLRP1, activating an NLRP1 inflammasome and inducing pyroptosis in the infected macrophages.

Retinoic acid produced by intestinal dendritic cells acts with TGF-ß to induce Treg differentiation while suppressing the differentiation of TH17 cells (see Fig. 9.33).; 504: Both the generation of Treg cells and their expression of gut-homing molecules require that the dendritic cells produce retinoic acid, which is derived from the metabolism of dietary vitamin A through the action of retinal dehydrogenases.; 504: Retinoic acid-producing dendritic cells are also found in Peyer’s patches, and may also be important for generating regulatory T cells either in the Peyer’s patch itself, or after they migrate to the mesenteric lymph node.","DC (Secrete) Retinoic acid","false","Secrete","DC (Secrete) Retinoic acid","",""
"CD4:CD8 Crosstalk","Activate","370: The binding of CD70 on dendritic cells to its constitutively expressed CD27 receptor on naive T cells delivers a potent co-stimulatory signal to T cells early in the activation process.; 283: CD28 is present on the surface of all naive T cells and binds the co-stimulatory ligands B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which are expressed mainly on specialized antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. To become activated, the naive lymphocyte must engage both antigen and a co-stimulatory ligand on the same antigen-presenting cell. CD28 signaling aids antigen-dependent T-cell activation mainly by promoting T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cell survival. All these effects are mediated by signaling motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28... (p284): Together with the CD28-induced phosphorylation of NF-90 leading to increased IL-2 mRNA stability, CD28 co-stimulation leads to substantially increased production of IL-2 by activated T cells.; 368: The best-characterized co-stimulatory molecules are the B7 molecules. These homodimeric members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are found exclusively on the surfaces of cells, such as dendritic cells, that stimulate naive T-cell proliferation (see Section 9-8). The receptor for B7 molecules on the T cell is CD28, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see Section 7-21). Ligation of CD28 by B7 molecules is necessary for the optimal clonal expansion of naive T cells; targeted deficiency of B7 molecules or experimental blockade of the binding of B7 molecules to CD28 has been shown to inhibit T-cell responses.; 368: Figure 9.22  Three kinds of signals are involved in activation of naive T cells by antigen-presenting cells. Binding of the foreign-peptide:self MHC complex by the T-cell receptor and, in this example, a CD4 co-receptor transmits a signal (arrow 1) to the T cell that antigen has been encountered. effective activation of naive T cells requires a second signal (arrow 2), the co-stimulatory signal, to be delivered by the same antigen-presenting cell (APC).; 285: While naive T- and B-cell activation requires signaling through the antigen receptors on these cells, T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor signaling, respectively, is not sufficient to activate the cells. For naive T cells, an additional co-stimulatory signal is required and, as discussed above (see Sections 7-21 and 7-22), is frequently provided by the CD28 receptor.; 369: Co-stimulation through CD28 contributes to the production of IL-2 in at least three ways.; 370: The receptor CD40 on dendritic cells binds to CD40 ligand expressed on T cells, initiating two-way signaling that transmits activating signals to the T cell and also induces the dendritic cell to express increased B7, thus stimulating further T-cell proliferation.; 30: CD4 T cells recognize antigen presented by MHC class II proteins, which are expressed by the predominant antigen-presenting cells of the immune system: dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells; 166: The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules expressed by dendritic cells can function to activate naive CD4 T cells.; 216: For loading peptides onto MHC class II molecules, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells are able to capture exogenous proteins via endocytic vesicles and through specific cell-surface receptors. For B cells, this process of antigen capture can include the B-cell receptor. The peptides that are derived from these proteins are loaded onto MHC class II molecules in specially modified endocytic compartments in these antigen-presenting cells, which we will discuss in more detail later. In dendritic cells, this pathway operates to activate naive CD4 T cells to become effector T cells.; 223: The immunological function of MHC class II molecules is to bind peptides generated in the intracellular vesicles of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and to present these peptides to CD4 T cells. The purpose for this pathway is different for each cell type. Dendritic cells primarily are concerned with activating CD4 T cells, while macrophages and B cells are concerned with receiving various forms of help from these CD4 T cells.; 230: This means that by the time dendritic cells arrive at lymph nodes, they express peptides derived from the pathogens that activated them and have higher CD86 levels that provide signals for greater CD4 T-cell activation.; 362: By the time activated dendritic cells arrive within lymphoid tissues, they are no longer able to engulf antigens by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis. They instead express very high levels of long-lived MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, which enable them to stably present peptides from pathogens already taken up and processed. Of equal importance, they express high levels of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. There are two main co-stimulatory molecules: the structurally related transmembrane glycoproteins B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which deliver co-stimulatory signals by interacting with receptors on naive T cells (see Section 7-21).; 372: B7 expressed by the dendritic cell first activates the CD4 T cells to express IL-2 and CD40 ligand (see Sections 9-16 and 9-17).; 393-394: In most cases, the antigen-presenting cells responsible for activating naive T cells, and inducing their clonal expansion, are conventional dendritic cells that express the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2.; 332: When the T-cell receptor of a mature naive T cell is strongly ligated by a peptide:MHC complex displayed on a specialized antigen-presenting cell in a peripheral lymphoid organ, the T cell is activated to proliferate and produce effector T cells.; 359: The versatility in pathways for antigen uptake enables dendritic cells to present antigens from virtually any type of microbe, including fungi, parasites, viruses, and bacteria (Fig. 9.15). Uptake of extracellular antigens by these pathways directs them into the endocytic pathway, where they are processed and presented on MHC class II molecules (see Chapter 6) for recognition by CD4 T cells.; 369: The initial encounter with specific antigen in the presence of a co-stimulatory signal triggers entry of the T cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle; at the same time, it also induces the synthesis of IL-2 along with the a chain of the IL-2 receptor (also known as CD25).; 402: CD4 T cells specific for such viral peptides may have been activated by dendritic cells earlier in the infection, and some will have differentiated into TFH cells.; 358: Dendritic cells take up, process, and present antigens from all types of sources, and are present mainly in the T-cell areas where they drive the initial clonal expansion and   differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells.","DC (Activate) T_CD4","false","Activate","DC (Activate) T_CD4","CD70, B7, CD40, MHCII","CD27, CD28, CD40L, TCR"

Cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems at these sites are specialized to secrete cytokines that promote a type 2 response to parasitic infection. In the presence of an invading parasite, dendritic cells taking up antigens in these tissues migrate to regional lymph nodes, where they tend to drive antigen-specific naive CD4 T cells to become effector TH2 cells. TH2 cells themselves secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, thus maintaining an environment in which further differentiation of TH2 cells is favored. The cytokine IL-33, which can be produced by activated mast cells and by damaged or injured epithelial cells, also contributes to amplification of the TH2 response. IL-33 can act directly on TH2 cells via the IL-33 receptors that these cells express.; 462: Dendritic cells required for the presentation of helminth antigens to naive CD4 T cells appear to be activated by IL-13 produced by ILC2 cells and innate cytokines, such as epithelium-derived TSLP, which repress the development of TH1- and TH17-inducing dendritic cells in favor of dendritic cells that promote TH2 cell differentiation.","DC (Polarize) T_CD4","false","Polarize","DC (Polarize) T_CD4","",""

This exogenous pathway of loading MHC class I molecules is called cross-presentation, and is carried out very efficiently by some specialized types of dendritic cells (Fig. 6.3). The activation of naive T cells by this pathway is called cross-priming.; 470: Figure 11.21; 372: CD40 ligand binds CD40 on the dendritic cell, delivering an additional signal that increases the expression of B7 and 4-1BBL by the dendritic cell, which in turn provides additional co-stimulation to the naive CD8 T cell.; 470: Licensing involves the induction of co-stimulatory molecules such as B7, CD40, and 4-1BBL on the dendritic cell, which can then deliver signals that fully activate naive CD8 T cells (see Fig. 9.29).; 362: By the time activated dendritic cells arrive within lymphoid tissues, they are no longer able to engulf antigens by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis.

They bind stably to monomeric IgE antibodies through the very high-affinity receptor FceRI. Antigen cross-linking of the bound IgE antibody molecules triggers rapid degranulation, releasing inflammatory mediators into the surrounding tissue. These mediators trigger local inflammation, which recruits cells and proteins required for host defense to sites of infection. These cells are also triggered during allergic reactions when allergens bind to IgE on mast cells.; 270: The Fce receptor (FceRI) is found on mast cells and basophils.

"","Inhibit","289: When the B-cell receptor binds an antigen that is already present in immune complexes with IgG, the ITIM-containing Fc receptor Fc<U+03B3>RIIB is engaged at the same time as the B-cell receptor. The Src-family kinase present at the B-cell receptor (BCR) phosphorylates the ITIM motif of Fc<U+03B3>RIIB, which then recruits the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase SHIP. SHIP dephosphorylates PIP3 in the plasma membrane, generating PIP2. PH domain-containing enzymes, such as Vav, Btk, and PLC-<U+03B3>, depend on their PH domain binding to PIP3 for their stable recruitment to the activated B-cell receptor complex. The loss of PIP3 terminates the recruitment of these enzymes and inhibits B-cell receptor signaling.; 288: Other receptors on B cells and T cells also contain ITIMs and can inhibit cell activation when ligated along with the antigen receptors. One example is the receptor Fc<U+03B3>RIIB-1 on B cells, which binds the Fc region of IgG antibodies. As a result, antigens present as immune complexes containing IgG antibodies are poor at activating naive B cells, due to the co-engagement of the B-cell receptor with this inhibitory Fc receptor.; 433: Table Figure 10.38","IgG (Inhibit) B","false","Inhibit","IgG (Inhibit) B","","FcgRIIB, FcgRIIB1"

Binding of IgG to this receptor activates the killing function of the nK cell, leading to the process known as antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).; 436: NK cells (see Chapter 3) are large granular non-T, non-B lymphoid cells that have Fc<U+03B3>RIII (CD16) on their surface. When these cells encounter cells coated with IgG antibody, they rapidly kill the target cell. ADCC is only one way in which NK cells can contribute to host defense.; 433: Table Figure 10.38; 435: As well as this innate function, NK cells can recognize and destroy antibodycoated target cells in a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is triggered when antibody bound to the surface of a cell interacts with Fc receptors on the NK cell (Fig. 10.42). NK cells express the receptor Fc<U+03B3>RIII (CD16), which recognizes the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. The killing mechanism is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells, involving the release of cytoplasmic granules containing perforin and granzymes (see Section 9-31).

For naive B cells, the additional activation signal can be contributed by direct interactions between the pathogen and an innate pattern recognition receptor (PRR), such as a TLR, on the B cell. However, for more effective B-cell activation leading to the production of all classes of antibodies and to the formation of memory B cells, additional B-cell activation signals are contributed by CD4 T cells. One component of this is the production of T-cell cytokines, which bind to and stimulate their receptors on the B-cell surface (see Chapter 10). The second and more essential component provided by the CD4 T cells is the stimulation of CD40 on the B cell by the CD40 ligand expressed on the T cell.; 400: cD40L on the Tfh cell binds to cD40 on the B cell, activating the noncanonical nf<U+03BA>B signaling pathway via nf<U+03BA>B-inducing kinase (niK).; 401: This occurs when antigen bound by surface immunoglobulin on the B cell is internalized and degraded within the B cell and peptides derived from it are returned to the cell surface in a complex with MHC class II molecules (see Fig. 10.2, first panel). When the TFH cell recognizes these peptide:MHC complexes, it provides the B cell with signals that favor survival and induce proliferation. These signals include the activation of CD40 on B cells by TFH expression of its ligand, CD40L (CD154), and production of various cytokines by TFH cells, including IL-21 (Fig. 10.3).; 406: Nevertheless, T cells still provide important signals for plasma-cell differentiation and survival, such as IL-6 and CD40 ligand.; 421: Follicular helper T cells stimulate B cells by conjugation in germinal centers, with binding of CD40 ligand on the T cell to CD40 on the B cell, and by their release of cytokines, such as IL-21.; 377: TFH cells also express ICOS, the ligand for which is expressed abundantly by B cells.; 31: When T follicular helper (TFH) cells recognize antigen on B cells (bottom panel), they activate these cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells (not shown); 476: As in primary responses, secondary B-cell responses begin at the interface between the T-cell and B-cell zones, where memory B cells that have acquired antigen can present peptide:MHC class II complexes to helper T cells. This interaction initiates proliferation of both the B cells and T cells.; 476: Memory B cells express somewhat higher levels of MHC class II molecules and the co-stimulatory ligand B7.1 than do naive B cells. This helps memory B cells acquire and present antigen more efficiently to TFH cells compared with naive B cells, and to TFH cells through the B7.1 receptor CD28, so that they can in turn help in antibody production so it begins earlier after antigen exposure compared with primary responses.","Tfh (Activate) B","false","Activate","Tfh (Activate) B","CD30L, CD40L, ICOS, TCR","CD30, CD40, ICOSL, MHCII"

This allows Salmonella to both evade detection by flagellin-speciic T cells and use the host macrophage as a safe haven to shield it from extracellular killing—at least temporarily—as the infection spreads systemically. During the systemic phase of the infection, the T-cell response shifts to become focused on those antigens that enable the intracellular lifestyle of the pathogen.

CD21 (also known as complement receptor 2, CR2) is a receptor for the C3dg fragment of complement. This means that antigens such as bacterial pathogens on which C3dg is bound (see Fig. 7.27) can cross-link the B-cell receptor with the CD21:CD19:CD81 complex. This induces phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of CD19 by B-cell receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, which in turn leads to the binding of additional Src-family kinases, the augmentation of signaling through the B-cell receptor itself, and the recruitment of PI 3-kinase (see Section 7-4).; 281: B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is greatly enhanced when the antigen is tagged by complement fragments, engaging the B-cell co-receptor together with the B-cell antigen receptor. Cleavage of the antigen-bound complement component C3 to C3dg (see Fig. 2.30) allows the tagged antigen to bind to the cell-surface protein CD21 (complement receptor 2, CR2), a component of the B-cell co-receptor complex, which also includes CD19 and CD81 (TAPA-1).; 63: Table Figure 2.30; 402: When CD21, or complement receptor 2 (CR2), binds to the complement fragments C3d and C3dg that are deposited on microbial surfaces (see Section 2-13), it is brought near to the activated B-cell receptor bound to the same surface.

Paneth cells are found only in the small intestine, where they produce antimicrobial peptides such as RegIII<U+03B3> and defensins when exposed to IL-22 released by CD4 TH17 cells or ILC3s.; 467: Similarly, stimulation of TH2 and ILC2 cells by TSLP (STAT5) plus IL-33 produces IL-5 and IL-13, and both TH17 and ILC3 cells stimulated by IL-23 (STAT3) plus IL-1 produce IL-17 and IL-22.; 468: Figure 11.19; 465: IL-17 and IL-22 produced by TH17 cells induce the production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells  ->  Direct killing or growth inhibition of bacteria attached to the epithelium; 465: IL-22 produced by TH17 increases epithelial cell turnover; 466: While ILC3 cells in barrier tissues respond rapidly to pathogens to produce IL-22, pathogen-specific TH17 cells have been shown to amplify and sustain the production of IL-22 at sites of infection.; 374: Cytokines produced by TH17 cells, including IL-17 and IL-22, are also important in activating barrier epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts and the skin, to produce antimicrobial peptides that resist microbial invasion.; 503: In mice, the most abundant subset of dendritic cells in the Peyer’s patch expresses CD11b (aM integrin) and, when activated, tends to produce IL-23. This promotes development of TH17 cells and stimulates ILC3 cells, both of which produce IL-17 and IL-22 (see Sections 3-23 and 11-2).; 812: Table Appendix III","Th17 (Secrete) IL22","false","Secrete","Th17 (Secrete) IL22","",""

"Antibacterial, Anti-IC bacteria, Type 1, Antimicrobial, Inflammation","Secrete","30: For example, the TH1 subset of CD4 T cells helps to control certain bacteria that take up residence in membrane-enclosed vesicles inside macrophages. They produce the same cytokine as ILC1 cells, IFN-<U+03B3>, which activates macrophages to increase their intracellular killing power and destroy these bacteria.; 619: Although TH2 cytokines appear to predominate in this chronic phase of asthma, TH1 cytokines (such as IFN-<U+03B3>) and TH17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22) can also participate; 126: The production of IFN-<U+03B3> by NK cells early in an immune response can directly activate macrophages to enhance their capacity to kill pathogens, augmenting innate immunity, but also influences adaptive immunity through actions on dendritic cells and in regulating the differentiation of CD4 T cells into the pro-inflammatory TH1 subset, which produces IFN-<U+03B3>. NK cells also produce TNF-a, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the chemokines CCL3 (MIF 1-a), CCL4, and CCL5 (RANTES), which act to recruit and activate macrophages.; 233: Gene expression of the classical MHC class II proteins, along with the invariant-chain, DMa, DMß, and DOa, but not DOß, is coordinately increased by IFN-<U+03B3>, which is produced by activated TH1 cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells.; 666: Inflammation causes increased vascular permeability, and the site becomes heavily infiltrated by TH17 and TH1 effector CD4 T cells, which produce IL-17, IFN-<U+03B3>, and GM-CSF. Cytokines and chemokines produced by these effector T cells in turn recruit and activate myeloid cells that exacerbate inflammation, resulting in further recruitment of T cells, B cells, and innate immune cells to the lesion. Autoreactive B cells produce autoantibodies against myelin antigens with help from T cells.; 363: Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells through TLR-9 induces the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), a TNF-family transmembrane cytokine, which binds to CD40, a TNF-family receptor that is expressed by  activated conventional dendritic cells. This interaction enables conventional dendritic cells to sustain production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, strengthening the IL-12-induced production of IFN-<U+03B3> by T cells.; 363: Normally, IL-12 made by conventional dendritic cells induces CD4 T cells to produce abundant IFN-<U+03B3>, which helps macrophages kill the bacteria.; 366: For example, as discussed in Chapter 11, by presenting antigens of ingested pathogens, macrophages recruit help from IFN-<U+03B3>-producing CD4 T cells to augment their intracellular killing of these pathogens.; 373: TH1 cells (first panels) produce cytokines, such as IFn-<U+03B3>, which activate macrophages, enabling them to destroy intracellular microorganisms more efficiently.; 373: TH1 cells are characterized by the production of IFN-<U+03B3>, whereas TH2 cells are characterized by the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.; 374: If a TH1 cell recognizes bacterial antigens displayed on the surface of an infected macrophage, it will activate the macrophage further through the release of IFN-<U+03B3>, which enhances the macrophage’s microbicidal activity to kill ingested bacteria.; 375: Finally, TH1 cells themselves may provide IFN-<U+03B3>, thus reinforcing the signal for the differentiation of more TH1 cells through a positive feedback loop.; 376: Similar to the positive feedback for TH1 cell development provided by IFN-<U+03B3> produced by activated TH1 cells, IL-4 produced by activated TH2 cells may amplify TH2 development from naive T-cell precursors.; 377: For example, both IFN-<U+03B3> (produced by TH1 cells) and IL-4 (produced by TH2 cells) potently inhibit TH17 development, promoting TH1 or TH2 development, respectively (Fig. 9.34).; 377: Conversely, IFN-<U+03B3>, a product of TH1 cells, can inhibit the proliferation of TH2 cells (see Fig. 9.34).; 377: TH1 cells generate copious amounts of IFN-<U+03B3> when they recognize antigen on a target cell, thus reinforcing the signal for the differentiation of more TH1 cells through a positive feedback loop.; 378: Activated TH1 cells secrete IFN-g; 378: IFn-<U+03B3> produced by TH1 cells blocks the growth of TH2 cells (right panels).; 384: TH1 cells are specialized to activate macrophages that are infected by or have ingested pathogens; they secrete IFn-<U+03B3> to activate the infected cell, as well as other effector molecules.; 385: Table Figure 9.4; 635: Figure 14.25; 457: Figure 11.9; 458: When an effector TH1 cell specific for a bacterial peptide contacts an infected macrophage, the T cell is induced to secrete the macrophage-activating factor IFN-<U+03B3> and to express CD40 ligand.

And figure 11.10; 460: TH1 cells produce IFN-g and CD40L, which induce and activate M1 macrophages; 461: However, although IFN-<U+03B3> and CD40 ligand are probably the most important effector molecules synthesized by TH1 cells, the immune response to pathogens that proliferate in macrophage vesicles is complex, and other cytokines secreted by TH1 cells may also be crucial (see Fig. 11.12).; 462: The requirement for CD4 T cells seems to be due, at least in part, to a requirement for the macrophage-activating cytokines IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a produced by TH1 cells.; 466: Figure 11.17; 467: Thus, for both TH1 cells and ILC1 cells, stimulation by IL-12 (STAT4) plus IL-18 induces production of IFN-<U+03B3>.; 468: Figure 11.19; 524: IL-23 and IL-12 in concert can also induce inflammatory TH1 responses in the intestine, with some CD4 effector T cells found to produce both IFN-<U+03B3> and IL-17 under these circumstances.; 635: Activated gliadin-specific CD4 T cells accumulate in the lamina propria, producing IFN-<U+03B3>, a cytokine that when present in this location leads to intestinal inflammation.; 544: Because CD40 signaling is also required for the activation of dendritic cells and macrophages for optimal production of IL-12, which is important for the production of IFN-<U+03B3> by TH1 cells and NK cells, patients with CD40 ligand deficiency also have defects in type 1 immunity and thus manifest a form of combined immunodeficiency.; 546: These microbes are specialized for survival within macrophages, and their eradication requires enhanced microbicidal activities induced by IFN-<U+03B3> produced by type 1 cells: NK cells, ILC1 cells, and TH1 cells (see Section 11-2).; 631: The response is caused by TH1 cells, which enter the site of antigen injection, recognize complexes of peptide:MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, and release inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-<U+03B3>, TNF-a, and lymphotoxin.

These granules contain preformed P-selectin, which appears on the surfaces of local endothelial cells just minutes after macrophages have responded to the presence of microbes by producing TNF-a.; 116: P-selectin appears on endothelial cell surfaces within a few minutes of exposure to leukotriene B4, C5a, or histamine, which is released from mast cells in response to C5a.

NK cells also produce TNF-a, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the chemokines CCL3 (MIF 1-a), CCL4, and CCL5 (RANTES), which act to recruit and activate macrophages.; 363: Normally, IL-12 made by conventional dendritic cells induces CD4 T cells to produce abundant IFN-<U+03B3>, which helps macrophages kill the bacteria.; 373: TH1 cells (first panels) produce cytokines, such as IFn-<U+03B3>, which activate macrophages, enabling them to destroy intracellular microorganisms more efficiently.; 374: If a TH1 cell recognizes bacterial antigens displayed on the surface of an infected macrophage, it will activate the macrophage further through the release of IFN-<U+03B3>, which enhances the macrophage’s microbicidal activity to kill ingested bacteria.; 379: elimination of infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania major requires a TH1 response, because IFn-<U+03B3> is needed to activate the macrophages that provide protection.; 384: TH1 cells are specialized to activate macrophages that are infected by or have ingested pathogens; they secrete IFn-<U+03B3> to activate the infected cell, as well as other effector molecules.; 385: Table Figure 9.4; 392: IFN-<U+03B3> also activates macrophages, recruiting them to sites of infection, where they serve both as effector cells and as antigen-presenting cells.; 392: CD8 cytotoxic T cells also produce IFN-<U+03B3>, which inhibits viral replication and is an important inducer of MHC class I molecule expression and macrophage activation.; 451: ILC1s lack the cytolytic granules that are characteristic of NK cells and CTLs, and appear to promote clearance of intracellular pathogens through their activation of infected macrophages by the release of IFN-<U+03B3>.; 451: Thus, through their production of IL-12 and IL-18, macrophages can rapidly induce ILC1 production of IFN-<U+03B3>, which acts back on the macrophage to induce its heightened killing of intracellular pathogens several days prior to the development and recruitment of TH1 cells.; 458: When an effector TH1 cell specific for a bacterial peptide contacts an infected macrophage, the T cell is induced to secrete the macrophage-activating factor IFN-<U+03B3> and to express CD40 ligand. Together these newly synthesized TH1 proteins activate the macrophage.  And figure 11.10 ...This boost to antimicrobial mechanisms is known as ‘classical’ macrophage activation, the result of which is the so-called classically activated, or M1, macrophage; 459: CD8 T cells also produce IFN-<U+03B3> and can activate macrophages presenting antigens derived from cytosolic proteins on MHC class I molecules.; 460: TH1 cells produce IFN-g and CD40L, which induce and activate M1 macrophages; 460: IFN-<U+03B3> and CD40 ligand synergize in activating the macrophage, which allows it to kill engulfed pathogens.; 462: The requirement for CD4 T cells seems to be due, at least in part, to a requirement for the macrophage-activating cytokines IFN-<U+03B3> and TNF-a produced by TH1 cells.; 233: Gene expression of the classical MHC class II proteins, along with the invariant-chain, DMa, DMß, and DOa, but not DOß, is coordinately increased by IFN-<U+03B3>, which is produced by activated TH1 cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells. This form of regulation allows dendritic cells and macrophages to upregulate molecules involved in processing of intravesicular antigens when presenting antigens to T cells and NK cells. Expression of all these molecules is induced by IFN-<U+03B3> (but not by IFN-a or -ß), via the production of a protein known as MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), which acts as a positive transcriptional co-activator of MHC class II genes.; 470: IFN-g produced by bystander CD8 T cells can activate macrophages and other cells to promote general resistance to bacteria and viruses; 633: Figure 14.22  The products of keratinocytes and TH1 cells activate macrophages to secrete mediators of inflammation; 632: Figure 14.21; 811: Table Appendix III","IFNg (Activate) Macrophage","false","Activate","IFNg (Activate) Macrophage","",""
